# Unity-Tank-Game

My first unity project. I created this to learn the interface and features of unity 5.x. 

The project is a simple online tank game, where your aim is to push your opponent from the platform by shooting or pushing.

Features:
- Menu with some animation
- UNET for multiplayer
- Custom camera in game
- PC build only (other builds later, maybe..)

# Unity-Tank-Game

This game is my first unity project, where the aim was to get used to the unity interface as well as to learn about the features of unity 5.x and UNET.

The game is a simple online tank game, where your aim is to push your opponent from the platform by shooting or pushing. The game has basic menu for hosting and joining the game and the actual game has one map to play. 

The current version should be a bit bugged and laggy, but crash free and playable with good connection. The main concerns are the physics of tank and the smoothing of the movement of tanks.

Features:
- Menu with some animation
- UNET for multiplayer
- Custom camera in game (I didn't use the unity provided camera functionality)
- PC build only (mobile later, when I have time)

Controls:
- W,A,S,D,Q,E: Rotate your tank
- Left shift: Accelerate
- Control or Mouse 1: Shoot
